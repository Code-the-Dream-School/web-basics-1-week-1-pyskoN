        <p>I am very excited to be part of 2020 Code The Dream class. I wanted to learn how to code ever since
          a university course on how Google understands and translates texts so accurately (most of the times). 
          My plans are so big, Napoleon would be proud. I want to master: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Ruby (though, I'm still considering this one)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I want to understand machines and the language they speak and, thus, be able to make it
             do what I want it to - display a beautiful webpages I will (know how) create.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I would like to meet like minded people to share ideas and enthusiasm on coding. </p>
